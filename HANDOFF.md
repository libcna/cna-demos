# HANDOFF

**Read this first in every new session.** It is the single place that says what state the
project is in and what to do next. Update it after every batch. Last updated: 2026-10-12.

## 1. Purpose (one paragraph)

cna-demos is a growing collection of small executable demonstrations of CNA (C++ XNA 4.0
reimplementation): one concept per demo, stable textual IDs, metadata, a terminal browser, a CLI,
unattended runs, CTest tests and a coverage report. Long-term goal: every meaningful CNA
capability has a demo. See docs/PROJECT.md.

## 2. Current phase

Systematic demo batches, one CNA area at a time (status per phase in docs/ROADMAP.md):

* Complete: Phase 0-1 (research, infrastructure), 2 (math, 78 + 6 packed vectors), 3 (game lifecycle, 33), 4 (2D
  graphics), 5 (render states, buffers, primitives, render targets), 10 (input, 39), 11 (storage, 7).
* Mostly complete: 6 (effects and shaders, 31).
* In progress: 7 (models/glTF, 23), 8 (content, 46), 9 (audio 21 incl. 9 XACT, media 11 incl. a
  compiled video and song), **12 (gamer services 19 incl. avatars and leaderboards; net 14; remainders in ROADMAP)**.
* In progress too: 13 (devices 5, phone 1, design 4, diagnostics 2 + logger 2, cnaext 4).
* In progress: 14 (C API, 19 standalone C demos; `linux-full` builds CNA with `CNA_BUILD_C_API=ON`).
* In progress: 15 (type decisions and deeper public-member/behavior tables in docs/COVERAGE_AUDIT.md;
  comprehensive semantic coverage is not yet established).

## 3. Architecture in 10 lines

* One executable `cna-demos` (src/app: CLI `Cli.cpp`, browser `Browser.cpp`).
* Framework (src/framework, headers src/CnaDemos): `Registry`, `DemoInfo` metadata, `DemoContext`
  (output/checks/seed), `DemoGame : Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Game`, `Runner`, catalog JSON,
  validation, process helpers.
* Demos: `demos/<category>/.../<name>.cpp`, ID = path, registered by `CNA_DEMOS_CONSOLE`/
  `CNA_DEMOS_GAME`; each category is an OBJECT library found by `GLOB_RECURSE CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`.
* Standalone demos: `standalone/<id>/{metadata.cpp,main.cpp,CMakeLists.txt}` → `cna-demo-<id-with-dashes>`.
* `ownProcess` demos (gamer services: once-per-process dispatcher) are in-process Game demos that
  batch runs and the browser start as `cna-demos <id> --batch-child --report <tmp>`.
* CNA consumed via `add_subdirectory(${CNA_ROOT_DIR} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL SYSTEM)`, linking `CNA`.
* Renderer: CNA's `CNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER(S)`; runtime `--renderer` (one renderer per process).
* Project graphics profile set to HiDef in `main` (Reach demos opt in).
* CTest: `cna_demos.cli.*` + per-demo tests discovered at ctest time (`--list-ids`).
* Coverage: `tools/coverage_report.py` → docs/COVERAGE.md (matches `.apis` to CNA's XNA inventory).
* Full details: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

## 4. What is complete

* CMake (presets `default`, `windowless`, `linux-multi`, `linux-full`, `linux-full-release`),
  CNA integration, warnings, packaging helpers, asset copying.
* Registry, metadata, validation (`--validate`), catalog (`--catalog-json`), results (`--report`).
* Browser (tree navigation, search, info, run in-process, back) and CLI (see `--help`).
* DemoGame: need checks → SKIPPED, automated frame limit, Escape/Back exit, `--screenshot`.
* CTest integration and CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, windowless preset).
* Docs: README, PLAN, CLAUDE, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES, docs/*.
* Pilot demos (9) and math batches (vectors, Matrix, Quaternion, MathHelper): see section 6.

## 5. Partially complete / known gaps

* Visual regression: screenshots exist, reference comparison not implemented (AUTOMATION.md §5).
* CI on GitHub (ubuntu-24.04, `windowless` preset): green since run 4 (the CTest discovery fix;
  checked through run 40); runs 1-3 failed only at the ctest step (`if(IN_LIST)` in ctest script
  mode on CMake 3.x).
  Check the latest run with the GitHub Actions list for `libcna/cna-demos`.
* `windowless` preset: see build status below.

## 7. Build and test status

**459 focused validation completed; full checkpoint is next.** Initial build passed (37 targets),
then two nine-target incremental builds corrected the DDS catch and added ISSUE-054 metadata.
Registry 459/0; source-only coverage 293/329 types, 1372/2326 XNA members, 166/3210 C routes.
DDS executes five checks on each renderer (three pass/two ISSUE-054 failures); shader package
passes eight on GL and declares a SOFTWARE capability skip; C dispatch has 44 passing child
checks plus the same two ISSUE-050 failures, retaining every original label/order. All focused
stderr is empty except the exact declared SOFTWARE CustomEffects diagnostic. The final GL
package capture matches the initial image actually inspected. Evidence: checkpoint-459-focused-*.
Initial demo-catch failure and corrected unmarked DDS evidence remain separately archived.

**Complete 457 checkpoint passed at ab2a92b.** tools/validate.sh exited 0; all 470 enabled
CTests passed (393.71 s), both complete isolated-X11 smokes and coverage regeneration finished.
Metadata: 457/0; coverage 293/329 types, 1372/2326 XNA members, 166/3210 C routes.
Original complete 456 comparison adds the eight-check cube face-transfer scene, extends
palette_sampling 14 -> 19 and node_animation 4 -> 9, and retains every old status/known issue,
all 35/36 failed assertions and all C/custom-content child lists/traces. GL game.window.title
changes 11 -> 10 from unchanged per-Update timing; no other unplanned count difference.
All 35 selected binaries/four assets stayed unchanged through runtime; normalized stderr is
identical (including the existing 84 GL X protocol lines). CNA dabb4a2cd observed at runtime
capture; final source state archived separately. No atomic build-input/dependency snapshot.

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Existing linux-full build | Passed; seven scheduled checkpoint targets, no compiler diagnostics |
| Metadata/assets --validate | 457 demos, 0 problems |
| tools/validate.sh | Passed, complete SOFTWARE/OPENGLES3 and coverage regeneration |
| CTest | 445 passed (including 25 WILL_FAIL), 25 skipped, 3 manual disabled; 0 failures |
| SOFTWARE smoke | 404 passed, 25 expected failures, 25 skipped, 3 manual not run |
| OPENGLES3 smoke | 425 passed, 26 expected failures, 3 skipped, 3 manual not run |
| Changed checks | Cube 8, palette 14 -> 19, node 4 -> 9; all 35/36 old failures retained |
| Binary/assets/stderr | Selected hashes stable and normalized diagnostics identical to original 456 |
| Screenshots | Four new captures actually inspected; cube pair RGBA-identical, node unchanged against its own baseline on each renderer |

Focused palette/node/cube runs pass 19/9/8 checks on both selections, all stderr empty. Node's
pre-existing cross-renderer difference is two pixels (max channel delta 73), not an identity
claim. The cube scene displays public readback through a 2D atlas; it proves neither direct GPU
readback nor cube shader sampling. Reports/catalog/helpers: build/linux-full/reports/checkpoint-457-*.
Previous complete 456 at e70eeb5 (closure fe93504): 469 enabled CTests, SW 403/25/25/3,
GL 424/26/3/3. All previous failures/preparation corrections remain in docs/CHECKPOINT_HISTORY.md.

System packages: README "Requirements". CMake >= 3.29 recommended; this session uses 3.31.6.

## 12. Important design decisions

PLAN.md §2 (table). The non-obvious ones: HiDef project profile; SOFTWARE as test renderer;
`SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=dummy` in tests; SKIPPED only for declared needs; standalone only for
process-level features; static CNA on CMake < 3.29.

## 13. Unusual and generated files

* `docs/COVERAGE.md` -- generated (tools/coverage_report.py). Do not edit by hand.
* `assets/*` -- generated (tools/generate_assets.py), committed, deterministic.
* `build*/` and `*.log` at the root -- ignored.

## 14. Next task

**Immediate next action:** commit the focused-validated 459 batch, replace PENDING_459 in
/tmp/cna-archive-459.py and /tmp/cna-459-finish.py, then start full tools/validate.sh. Capture
35 binaries/four assets after its build using /tmp/cna-capture-459.py. Catalog is
/tmp/cna-catalog-459.json. Source /tmp drafts for DDS/package/C destruction are APPLIED AND STALE.
No complete 459 runtime result exists yet; original COMPLETE 457 remains baseline.

Focused review /tmp/cna-review-459-focused.py passes: DDS has exactly two ISSUE-054 failures,
package has eight GL checks or its declared SOFTWARE skip, and C adds exactly six passing labels
to its original forty (44 pass/2 old failures total). All old C labels/order remain after removal
of the six named additions. C trace: Destroyed property: pending=1, result=3, category=3.
No new C route/ID. Final GL image is identical to the initial capture actually inspected.
The DDS catch correction was a demo bug: catch actual System::FormatException, not
std::runtime_error. Genuine ISSUE-054 follows separate five-check runs with complete/prefixed
controls, one seven-byte Read call and acceptance of corrupted truncated bytes at offset16.
No CNA source was edited, and no reader workaround was added.

Complete helpers compare to ORIGINAL 457 and permit only the new IDs, exact two DDS failures
(35/36 -> 37/38), six specified passing C labels, and positive title timing variance. The generic
comparator must request review (exit1) for the new failing ID/assertions; the wrapper explicitly
verifies that exact delta. Stderr may add only one exact SOFTWARE CustomEffects skip diagnostic
for the new package; all other normalized diagnostics must match. Expected, still unverified
full totals: 472 enabled CTests, SW 404/26/26/3, GL 426/27/3/3. Do not edit/rebuild during runtime.

After full 459, continue the semantic member audit. ShaderEffect::Clone deserves a bounded
public matrix/owned-program behavior probe against Effect::Clone's contract; existing source
recompiles shader strings and copies labels/language but appears not to preserve matrix state.
Do not file a bug from source alone or assume raw uniform setters have the same clone contract.
Invalid-syntax compiler diagnostics remain separate: unusable package selection throws
ShaderCompilationExceptionEXT, whereas usable payloads delegate to the legacy string compiler
and can return an invalid effect for bad syntax. Automatic Draw service is also still separate:
ordinary alternating frames cannot prove which step served a worker. Remaining cube gaps include
typed/compressed transfer paths, copy/shared-resource lifetime and actual sampler behavior;
remaining skinned gaps include independent diffuse lights1/2, alpha, vertex specular and joint scales.
No completed phase should be restarted, and no batch completion is a stopping condition.

## 15. Assumptions the next session must know

* Current workspace: `/rv/data/development/github.com/libcna/cna-demos`; CNA and the other
  dependencies are siblings (`../cna`, `../sharp-runtime`, `../easy-gl`, `../meta-gl`).
* Current verified toolchain: GCC 14.2 and CMake 3.31.6. Reuse `build/linux-full`; do not create
  temporary build trees. Set `CCACHE_DIR=/rv/cnaccache` and `CCACHE_BASEDIR=/rv` for every build.
* External work may change the sibling CNA checkout. Do not edit/revert it from this task;
  record the observed state and exercised binary hashes, and keep runtime checkpoints immutable.
* Running windowed renderers needs `xvfb-run`; audio needs a device or `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=dummy`.
