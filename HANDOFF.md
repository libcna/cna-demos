# HANDOFF

**Read this first in every new session.** It is the single place that says what state the
project is in and what to do next. Update it after every batch. Last updated: 2026-10-12.

## 1. Purpose (one paragraph)

cna-demos is a growing collection of small executable demonstrations of CNA (C++ XNA 4.0
reimplementation): one concept per demo, stable textual IDs, metadata, a terminal browser, a CLI,
unattended runs, CTest tests and a coverage report. Long-term goal: every meaningful CNA
capability has a demo. See docs/PROJECT.md.

## 2. Current phase

Systematic demo batches, one CNA area at a time (status per phase in docs/ROADMAP.md):

* Complete: Phase 0-1 (research, infrastructure), 2 (math, 78 + 6 packed vectors), 3 (game lifecycle, 33), 4 (2D
  graphics), 5 (render states, buffers, primitives, render targets), 10 (input, 39), 11 (storage, 7).
* Mostly complete: 6 (effects and shaders, 37).
* In progress: 7 (models/glTF, 23), 8 (content, 46), 9 (audio 22 incl. 9 XACT, media 11 incl. a
  compiled video and song), **12 (gamer services 19 incl. avatars and leaderboards; net 14; remainders in ROADMAP)**.
* In progress too: 13 (devices 5, phone 1, design 4, diagnostics 2 + logger 2, cnaext 4).
* In progress: 14 (C API, 19 standalone C demos; `linux-full` builds CNA with `CNA_BUILD_C_API=ON`).
* In progress: 15 (type decisions and deeper public-member/behavior tables in docs/COVERAGE_AUDIT.md;
  comprehensive semantic coverage is not yet established).

## 3. Architecture in 10 lines

* One executable `cna-demos` (src/app: CLI `Cli.cpp`, browser `Browser.cpp`).
* Framework (src/framework, headers src/CnaDemos): `Registry`, `DemoInfo` metadata, `DemoContext`
  (output/checks/seed), `DemoGame : Microsoft::Xna::Framework::Game`, `Runner`, catalog JSON,
  validation, process helpers.
* Demos: `demos/<category>/.../<name>.cpp`, ID = path, registered by `CNA_DEMOS_CONSOLE`/
  `CNA_DEMOS_GAME`; each category is an OBJECT library found by `GLOB_RECURSE CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`.
* Standalone demos: `standalone/<id>/{metadata.cpp,main.cpp,CMakeLists.txt}` → `cna-demo-<id-with-dashes>`.
* `ownProcess` Game/Console demos isolate once-per-process services or deliberate registry
  mutation; batch runs and the browser start them as `cna-demos <id> --batch-child --report <tmp>`.
* CNA consumed via `add_subdirectory(${CNA_ROOT_DIR} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL SYSTEM)`, linking `CNA`.
* Renderer: CNA's `CNA_GRAPHICS_RENDERER(S)`; runtime `--renderer` (one renderer per process).
* Project graphics profile set to HiDef in `main` (Reach demos opt in).
* CTest: `cna_demos.cli.*` + per-demo tests discovered at ctest time (`--list-ids`).
* Coverage: `tools/coverage_report.py` → docs/COVERAGE.md (matches `.apis` to CNA's XNA inventory).
* Full details: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.

## 4. What is complete

* CMake (presets `default`, `windowless`, `linux-multi`, `linux-full`, `linux-full-release`),
  CNA integration, warnings, packaging helpers, asset copying.
* Registry, metadata, validation (`--validate`), catalog (`--catalog-json`), results (`--report`).
* Browser (tree navigation, search, info, run in-process, back) and CLI (see `--help`).
* DemoGame: need checks → SKIPPED, automated frame limit, Escape/Back exit, `--screenshot`.
* CTest integration and CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, windowless preset).
* Docs: README, PLAN, CLAUDE, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES, docs/*.
* Pilot demos (9) and math batches (vectors, Matrix, Quaternion, MathHelper): see section 6.

## 5. Partially complete / known gaps

* Visual regression: screenshots exist, reference comparison not implemented (AUTOMATION.md §5).
* CI on GitHub (ubuntu-24.04, `windowless` preset): green since run 4 (the CTest discovery fix;
  checked through run 40); runs 1-3 failed only at the ctest step (`if(IN_LIST)` in ctest script
  mode on CMake 3.x).
  Check the latest run with the GitHub Actions list for `libcna/cna-demos`.
* `windowless` preset: see build status below.

## 7. Build and test status

Complete checkpoint **470-specular**, source `c9660d8`,
extends the existing shadow receiver from seven to nine GL controls. All nine pass with
empty focused stderr; SOFTWARE retains its exact declared stock-path skip. Seven original
assertion labels remain unchanged. The actual three-row 800x480 image was inspected and
all 15 selected pixels, including relocated original controls, match within tolerance 1.
The new specular-only panels have zero diffuse, ambient and emission. Disabled reception
preserves both RGB(76,38,13) highlights; enabled reception makes only the occluded half
black. This is single-map per-pixel directional specular evidence, not per-vertex, alpha,
cascade or punctual-specular behavior; no whole-image identity after the layout change.
Watched build 10959 passes 9 scheduled / 8 numbered operations with all 3,909 watched
inputs unchanged. Focused/targeted session 75346 passes 26 CTests in 2.64 s (two skips).
Full session 80513 builds in 7 scheduled operations without warning, validates 470 metadata
entries with 0 problems and passes all 483 enabled CTests in 150.15 s (449 passed,
including 27 WILL_FAIL; 34 skips; three additional manual tests disabled).
SOFTWARE 406/27/34/3, OPENGLES3 435/29/3/3. Every old 38/42 failed assertion, C/custom child
list/trace and all five network controls remain exact. Reviewed JSON count differences:
{"OPENGLES3": {"graphics.skinned_effect.shadow_receiver": {"after": 9, "before": 7, "reason": "Two isolated specular shadow controls added; original seven receiver predicates retained."}}, "SOFTWARE": {}}.
All 35 selected binaries/four existing assets and reader fixture copies remain unchanged
through runtime. Normalized application stderr is identical, including 42 known GL X
protocol records and the intentional shader error. Outer Xvfb has 17 exact amdgpu
pairs (previous 18); independent inner/outer exits 0. Capture CNA eff3131017
(clean), final CNA eff3131017 (clean).
These are selected artifact/source observations, not an atomic/full transitive input snapshot.
All capture/archive/finish helpers pass; immutable evidence: checkpoint-470-specular-*.
Generated coverage: 293/329 types, 1374/2326 XNA members, 174/3210 C routes.
No new ID or issue marker. Semantic coverage remains incomplete; build-only ISSUE-057 stays
open with its original refusal and independent private staging probe preserved.

## 11. Dependencies (pinned for CI; same as cna-template's dependencies.lock)

| Repo | Version | Commit |

System packages: README "Requirements". CMake >= 3.29 recommended; this session uses 3.31.6.

## 12. Important design decisions

PLAN.md §2 (table). The non-obvious ones: HiDef project profile; SOFTWARE as test renderer;
`SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=dummy` in tests; SKIPPED only for declared needs; standalone only for
process-level features; static CNA on CMake < 3.29.

## 13. Unusual and generated files

* `docs/COVERAGE.md` -- generated (tools/coverage_report.py). Do not edit by hand.
* `assets/*` -- generated (tools/generate_assets.py), committed, deterministic.
* `build*/` and `*.log` at the root -- ignored.

## 14. Next task

HIGHEST PRIORITY: apply and validate the same-ID 470-release looping extension.
Full470-specular session80513 is CLOSED0; sourcec9660d8 is the comparison baseline.
1. Apply /tmp/cna-loop-release.cpp to audio/sound_effect_instance/looping.cpp. Syntax95961
   passed, no native evidence yet. Original three controls plus paused Stop(false), Resume
   and bounded natural completion (six checks expected with dummy audio).
2. Watched build /tmp/cna-build-470-release.py initial; consistency if inputs change.
   Metadata, /tmp/cna-run-470-release-focused.py (five repetitions per requested renderer)
   and targeted shell. Run /tmp/cna-review-470-release-focused.py BEFORE committing:
   it requires the original function prefix through all three old checks unchanged.
3. Update semantic docs, commit, export /tmp/cna-catalog-470-release.json; full wrapper,
   capture once after build during CTest, freeze artifacts, archive both smokes and finish.
   Baseline470-specular,483enabled CTests, unchanged470totals; looping3->6checks on both
   selections only plus separately reviewed positive title Update variance.
4. Close docs/history/HANDOFF and commit, then continue the prepared public Pan/3D mode
   lifecycle /tmp/cna-spatial-mode.cpp. Syntax50498 passed, no native evidence yet.
   Original audible sweep remains; source-only draft adds six public state/refusal checks.
   Raw Pan changes on its refusal path must not be mistaken for observed output panning.
Preserve the original ISSUE-057 refusal/probes and investigate any new diagnostic.

## 15. Assumptions the next session must know

* Current workspace: `/rv/data/development/github.com/libcna/cna-demos`; CNA and the other
  dependencies are siblings (`../cna`, `../sharp-runtime`, `../easy-gl`, `../meta-gl`).
* Current verified toolchain: GCC 14.2 and CMake 3.31.6. Reuse `build/linux-full`; do not create
  temporary build trees. Set `CCACHE_DIR=/rv/cnaccache` and `CCACHE_BASEDIR=/rv` for every build.
* External work may change the sibling CNA checkout. Do not edit/revert it from this task;
  record the observed state and exercised binary hashes, and keep runtime checkpoints immutable.
* Running windowed renderers needs `xvfb-run`; audio needs a device or `SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER=dummy`.

Current complete baseline is470-specular, sourcec9660d8; closure follows.
Prior receiver/PCF/cascade/border/specular/query, audio formats/XACT, reader, move, field,
lighting, palette and EOF drafts are APPLIED AND STALE. Do not restore old /tmp source.
Preserve history and immutable checkpoint evidence, including original failures/probes.

Next UNAPPLIED: /tmp/cna-loop-release.cpp, syntax95961 CLOSED0, empty log. Six checks
expected, original three retained verbatim. Pause before Stop(false) prevents a racy
immediate-Playing assertion; Resume then bounded3s completion observes loop release.
No audible sample/tail-content or latency claim. Helpers /tmp/cna-*470-release* are ready,
UNRUN; source/notes/helper recovery under checkpoint-470-border-next-*.

Later UNAPPLIED: /tmp/cna-spatial-mode.cpp, syntax50498 CLOSED0, empty log. Existing
apply_3d adds six mode/refusal controls before its original audible sweep (seven total).
Uses only public Pan/Apply3D/Play/Pause/Stop/State, no internal mixer test access. A
refused Pan stores its property before CNA's mode gate; no transactional rollback or
output-pan change is assumed. Source notes/recovery checkpoint-470-specular-next-*.
No native/image/listening evidence. Prepared UNRUN spatial helper family: /tmp/cna-*470-spatial*,
recovery checkpoint-470-specular-next-helper-*. Baseline must be complete470-release.

Spatial member decisions remain in COVERAGE_AUDIT; source review adds no runtime credit.
Volume/pitch/pan already has three range refusals (five checks), corrected in470-border.
Open build-only ISSUE-057: checkpoint-470-query-initial-staging-refusal-* and
checkpoint-470-query-staging-probe-* preserve the original refusal and private reproduction.
No warning gate suppressed, unknown staging directory removed or CNA source changed.
Clean full validation does not resolve that race or establish its original interleaving.
